### Overview

All API calls to your Pinecone index authenticate with an [API key](projects#api-keys) for the project containing the target index. If you are using a client, like the Python or Node.js clients, you can initialize a client object, which allows you to provide your API key in one place and use it multiple times. If you are making HTTP requests with a tool like cURL, the HTTP request must include a header that specifies the API key. This topic describes each method.

### Finding your Pinecone API key

To find your API key, open the [Pinecone console](https://app.pinecone.io) and click **API Keys**. This view also displays the [environment](projects#project-environment) for your project.

### Initialize a client

To initialize a client with your API key and environment, use the following code:

<CodeGroup>

```Python Python
import pinecone

pinecone.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", environment="YOUR_ENVIRONMENT")
```

```JavaScript JavaScript
import { PineconeClient } from '@pinecone-database/pinecone';

const pinecone = new PineconeClient();

await pinecone.init({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    environment: "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Function calls with this client use the authentication information provided at initialization. For example:

<CodeGroup>

```Python Python
# Creates an index using the API key and environment stored in the client 'pinecone'.
pinecone.create_index("auth-guide", dimension=8, metric="euclidean")
```

```JavaScript JavaScript
// Constructs a create index request object.
const createRequest = {
    name: "auth-guide",
    dimension: 8,
    metric:"euclidean",
};

// Creates an index using the API key and environment stored in the client 'pinecone'.
await pinecone.createIndex({ createRequest });
```
</CodeGroup>

### Add a header to an HTTP request

When issuing an HTTP request to Pinecone, each request must contain an `Api-Key` header that specifies an API key. This API key must be valid for a project in the environment specified in the URL.

```bash curl
curl -i -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' \
  https://controller.YOUR_ENVIRONMENT.pinecone.io/databases \
  -d '{
    "name": "auth-guide",
    "dimension": 8,
    "metric": "euclidean"
  }'
```
