title: "Setting up billing through AWS Marketplace"
---

This document describes how to configure pay-as-you-go billing for your Pinecone organization through Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace. To commit to annual spending, [contact Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/contact).

<Note>

    This workflow creates a new Pinecone [organization](organizations). If you already have an organization, signing up through AWS Marketplace creates an additional organization.
</Note>

To configure Pinecone billing through the AWS Marketplace, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace). Your project must be enabled for purchase by your billing administrator.
2. Search for [the Pinecone listing](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-xhgyscinlz4jk).
3. Click **Subscribe**.
4. Read and agree to the terms and conditions.
5. Click **Subscribe**.
6. Click the **Set up your account** button.
7. Sign in to Pinecone.io.

When you sign in, Pinecone creates a new organization linked to your AWS billing.

If you already have a Pinecone organization, you can select the new "AWS Linked" organization in the organization drop-down menu in the console.
