title: "Setting up billing through Azure Marketplace"
---

This document describes how to configure pay-as-you-go billing for your Pinecone organization through Azure Marketplace. To commit to annual spending, [contact Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/contact).

<Note>
    This workflow creates a new Pinecone [organization](organizations). If you already have an organization, signing up through Azure Marketplace creates an additional organization.
</Note>

1. Log in to the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/).
2. Search for 'Pinecone'.
3. In the Pinecone result card, click **Get it now**.
4. Select the **Pinecone - Pay As You Go** plan.
5. Click **Subscribe**.
6. Select the Subscription and Resource group you would like your Pinecone Azure Marketplace Subscription to use.
7. Confirm that recurring billing is enabled.
8. Continue to the **Review and Subscribe** section to review your information.
9. Click **Subscribe**.
10. After the subscription is approved, click **Configure Account**. This redirects you to a Pinecone login page.
11. Log in to Pinecone.

When you sign in, Pinecone creates a new organization linked to your Azure Marketplace billing.

If you already have a Pinecone organization, you can select the new "Azure Linked" organization in the organization drop-down menu in the console.
